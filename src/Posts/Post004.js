			Wow, two posts in one week after four months of inactivity!  Merry Christmas!  Haha... well the truth is that I have been thinking about writing this post for a while, and now that my blog is all fixed up nice and looks great, I want to finally get it out there.  BTW, that picture in the header is not me!  I wish I had hair like that though.

			What is santosha?  If you go to yoga on a regular basis, you'll likely hear it.  Santosha is a word in Sanskrit which literally means "contentment."  But the broader meaning seems to be, keeping your balance, contentment and composure regardless of the circumstances going on around you.  In other words, in an imperfect world, and being an imperfect human, finding contentment with what is.
		</p>

			For the past year and a half, I have been teaching myself to be a software developer, and at the same time searching for my first job in that field.  To say it has been challenging would be a gross understatement.  There have been many days where I wake up and feel like a failure.  But I have had to dig deep and find a way to keep going anyway.  Finding this place where I can still be content with where I am, even though I am far away from where I want to be, has been one of my main focuses of the past year.  I'm not perfect, but I'm getting better at this, and this is a basic outline of what I've learned about it.
		</p>

		<h4>Health - Exercise, Meditation, and Sleep</h4>

		<p>
			There are three things that if I don't do them, I can feel a big impact on my mood.  Exercise (for me, yoga), meditation (every day) and getting enough sleep.  I am sure that eating well affects these areas too, but I haven't quite figured out a correlation between how I eat and how my mood feels yet.  I'm sure there is one, but that's why I didn't include it.
		</p>

		<p>
			I practiced yoga when I lived in Chicago for about five years.  But when I moved to Omaha almost three years ago, for some reason I didn't find a studio.  Recently I picked it up again.  And I have realized how big of an impact it makes.  I go two times a week.  If I have to miss even one time, a day or two after that missed session I will start feeling it.  It is one of those things where sometimes I don't want to go, but after I go I always feel better, no exceptions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another one of those things where sometimes I don't want to do it but I always feel better if I do is meditation.  I have used the Headspace meditation app for about three years now.  I love it.  I've tried meditating without it, but there's just something about the guided meditation for me that goes a lot better.  It only takes ten minutes, and I do it every day.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally, sleep.  Sleep has been a problem point for me in the past.  But getting enough exercise, doing meditation, and eating better in general I believe has helped me to sleep better at night.  When I don't sleep well, it affects everything else.
		</p>

		<h4>The learn/code regimen</h4>

		<p>
			I have found that I do better if I start the day off by learning something new, and then jumping into code later on in the day.  If I just try to code straight through for the whole day, it is too much time on my own with my own code and thoughts.  I need to inject someone else's way of doing things in there to break things up.  So, typically I will watch an online course and code along with the instructor for about an hour every morning to start off the day.  If I don't do this, toward the end of the day I can tell that I've had too much time on my own.
		</p>

		<h4>Knowing my limits</h4>

		<p>
			There have been days where I have pushed myself too hard.  I've found that I can do about five hours of really intense technical work per day.  After that, my brain seems to be telling me it's time to take care of other things.  If I try to keep going, I am going to find myself going backwards and making more mistakes that I will have to fix later on.  So it's best to just stick within that five hours per day usually.
		</p>

		<h4>No more shoulds</h4>

		<p>
			There is a word that I have tried to banish from my vocabulary, and that word is "should."  When I find myself surpassing my limits and doing too much, the usual culprit is that I have told myself a should somewhere along the way.  I "should" be further along.  I "should" have a job by now.  I "should" be working at this seventeen hours a day or else I don't really love it.  I "should" do this thing that this other person wants me to do even though I don't agree, instead of having a conversation with them about it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Shoulds are the way that I shame myself and try to get myself to do things I don't want to do, but they almost always backfire.  Maybe I'll work extra on my code for a day, but the next day feel so burned out that I won't want to do anything.
		</p>

		<p>
			Instead of shoulds, I try to either wait until I want to do that thing (known to others as "procrastination"), or I'll take it off my plate or have a conversation about it.  In the first case, I don't see procrastination as a bad thing as much anymore.  I think of it more as waiting until I have better information to take action.  Maybe if I wait to buy that Christmas gift I'll have a better idea of what I want to get that person.  Or sometimes it is a matter of unclear expectations, in which case I need to talk with the person doing the expecting and find out what they really want.
		</p>

		<h4>Let go of other people "getting" me</h4>

		<p>
			This has absolutely been the hardest thing for me to do, and I am still working on it.  A LOT of people don't seem to understand (or want to understand) why I'm doing this - teaching myself to code.  I've been put down and talked down to a lot.  Told I'll never make it, told to go back to QA.  That sort of thing.  I've had to learn how to let that stuff go.
		</p>

		<p>
			The first thing I've had to change is, stop trying to change myself to be what other people want me to be in order to fit in.  I used to do this all the time in the past, sometimes (actually, most of the time), without my even realizing that's what I was doing.  Changing myself to please someone else never works.  It makes me unhappy, and I don't recall a time where it has resulted in the situation changing for the better.
		</p>

		<p>
			Something else that I used to do, when changing myself didn't work, was to try and explain myself to other people.  This again doesn't work.  It's a waste of my time and energy if they don't get me from the outset.  They have to come to their own conclusions over time from seeing my actions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The thing that has helped me in both situations is the same.  I try to focus on the things that are going well, and leave the people and things that aren't alone.  I stop poking them with a stick!  I also try to realize that other people have their own agendas and their own battles that they are fighting.  It's not always about me.  My job isn't to change their minds, my job is to find people who like me as I am right now.  And it's my job to be patient and focus on my own stuff.  Eventually the good people and things will come around.
		</p>

		<h4>Gratitude</h4>

		<p>
			Finally, practicing gratitude for what I have is very important.  In every situation, even if it didn't pan out exactly the way I wanted it to, after it is over I try to find a way to be grateful for it.  You learn from every experience, good or bad, and the learning allows you to do better in the future.  Sometimes I've gone through really challenging and upsetting things, and later on I realize what I learned from it, and what I did well in that situation, and it makes me happy that I did it, and almost nostalgic.
		</p>

		<p>
			I hope this has helped you.  At the least it has helped me to put this all into words, so that the next time I wake up in the morning and feel down, I can look at this post and maybe feel a little better, and find that santosha a little more easily.
