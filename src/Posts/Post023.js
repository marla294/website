	<p>Hi :)  If anyone is actually reading this blog, I left you on kind of a terrible cliffhanger a couple months ago, which I want to resolve.  (sorry!)  Then I'll get into the subject of this blog post.</p>

	<h3>The personal update</h3>

	<p>My dad's doing okay.  Things seem to be going in a better direction than they were a couple months ago, anyway!  He finally got into Mayo Clinic.  His main doctor there is really good.  She said she is more worried about his organs failing than about the cancer itself!  Which made me feel quite a bit better, though we obviously don't want his organs to fail either.  His official diagnosis is kappa heavy chain disease, definitely better and more well-known than gamma heavy chain disease.  I've tried to stay away from Googling it - it's just a bad road for me.  I just want him to feel better.</p>

	<p>The only left hook we've had since he got back from Mayo Clinic was that, when he went in to get his first chemo treatment, they found that he needed to go on dialysis.  His kidneys were really in bad shape.  He's been doing dialysis 3 times a week for the past 5 weeks, and getting chemo once a week.  My mom says he is feeling better, though he has to take steroids too and those make him a bit crazy.  We won't know whether the chemo is working for another 3-4 weeks, but they say his blood numbers are better and that's a great sign.</p>

	<p>On the baby front, I'm still pregnant over here!  Tomorrow I'll be 35 weeks.  I'm still working full time, and plan to until the day we have the baby, which will be exactly 4 weeks from tomorrow.</p>

	<p>Baby seems very happy in there, judging by her enthusiastic kicking, but I can't say every moment of this has been fun for me.  She is getting big!  She takes up a lot of room in there that my lungs used to inhabit.  I've started having trouble sleeping, to the tune of nearly every night getting woken up by breathlessness or a stuffy nose that I can't seem to un-stuff.  I also have May-Thurner syndrome.  Which is when the arteries in your left leg are laid out in a weird way, and when you do stuff like, go on an airplane, or say, get pregnant, your leg and foot can get really swollen.  Which is what is happening to my left foot.  I have to wear a compression sock every day that is nearly impossible to put on around my huge belly, and I have to give myself blood thinner shots every day as well.  This is all to prevent having a pulmonary embolism from a blood clot in my leg, which I'm at a much higher risk of.  Also, to no one else's annoyance but my own, I currently only have 1 pair of shoes that fit.  I bought them, 2 months ago, 2 sizes bigger than I normally wear, and they just BARELY fit over my left foot.  And, the shoes are soooo ugly.</p>

	<p>But, it's worth it.  Won't go into detail, but we had a huge struggle getting pregnant in the first place - it took years - and it feels like a miricle that she's even coming.  So I'd take these small struggles any day of the week over not being able to get pregnant at all.  And this will all be over soon, and will be replaced with taking care of a newborn :)</p>

	<p>As for my son and husband - they're doing great.  They are putting up with me like champs.  And they are looking forward to meeting new baby girl :)</p>

	<h3>My relationship with social media</h3>

	<p>Let's move on to the main topic of this blog post, shall we?  It might seem a little trite, and seems like a lot of people my age are doing the same thing, but I want to talk a bit about my personal evolution with social media, and why I'm slowly trying to get off of it.</p>

	<p>Up until around 2015, I had no problem at all with social media.  I was on all of the major platforms - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.  I'm even going to count LinkedIn in this category (and I was on that too!), because they decided to add a (really dumb) newsfeed to their application and make it more Faceook-like.</p>

	<p>I used Facebook the most.  Back then, it was more fun - it was more about connecting with people who you directly knew.  It was literally like talking to your neighbors or your friends, even if they lived in other parts of the country.</p>

	<p>Around 2015, I started noticing that I didn't like how I felt when I used Facebook, in particular.  There were too many things on there that would make me mad and take up my time.  Political posts, mainly.  Lots of people out there claim that they can look at those sorts of things and not be affected by them.  I am not like that, and I realized that there's no way I can shut that aspect of myself off.  I was tired of wasting my time being angry about dumb things that I can't control.  So, I deactivated Facebook.</p>

	<p>That was the end of my regular use of Facebook.  I un-deactivated a couple times for various reasons, for a period of years, but was never a regular user after the initial deactivation.  Currently I've been deactivated for over a year, though I did go back on for a couple of days to say I'm pregnant (for folks that I haven't talked to in a while in real life).  That was an interesting experiment - after I announced it on there, all these people whom I sort of knew from high school chimed in to say "congrats."  I don't feel it was worth it, and I probably won't log back in to announce the birth.</p>

	<p>My Instagram use started to ramp up around 2018-2019.  At first it was just me posting photos of dumb things, but then I started following "influencers," and that's when it really started to take a bad turn for me.  If you don't know what influencers are, I'd describe them as, women posting about their lives and showcasing the very best parts.  They try to make it seem like they are being "authentic", that their lives are just naturally better than yours in every way, and they use that to sell you product so you can be more like them.  A lot of them will have an Instagram account, a blog, and a YouTube channel.  A classic example that I will put out there is <a href="https://www.theannaedit.com">theannaedit.com</a>, who is a British YouTuber that I followed for years.</p>

	<p>I'm a bit embarassed to admit that it took me a long, LONG time to recognize the ill effects of instagram "Influencers" on my life.  I thought, "oh I'm just getting shopping recommendations from them, and entertainment, how bad can it be?"  Until one day recently, I did a massive closet clean out, and realized that most of the stuff I was letting go were things that I was "influenced" to buy.  It was the same story with my makeup... and my home decor.  I'm still waiting on some stupid overly expensive pillows I ordered like, 3 months ago, directly due to an influencer!</p>

	<p>I realized that I was watching these women live their lives, and then subliminally emulating them, because it was easy entertainment.  It's way easier to go on Instagram or watch a video on YouTube than, say, play a game with your kid, or your husband.  Or read a book, or code, or cook a really good meal.  Or take a walk.</p>

	<p>The other platforms (aka, Twitter, LinkedIn, even I guess sort of YouTube), those aren't as much of a problem for me.  Twitter, I've never really understood that one, so I just made it private and don't post on it.  During my work hiatis to learn to code, I did post a lot - because I was lonely - but rarely did anyone ever respond.  Nowadays, I never look at it.  LinkedIn is just.... weird.  I'm toying with completely leaving LinkedIn because all it does is annoy me.  The only thing it seems to be good for is for random recruiters to contact me with jobs I will never in 1000 years take.  And YouTube, for whatever reason, I don't seem have a problem with.  I don't know why but, I rarely ever watch YouTube.</p>

	<h3>The straw that broke the camel's back: the book Digital Minimalism</h3>

	<p>In recent years, I've gone from thinking that social media is inherently harmless, to thinking, no, it's actively bad, and the people making these platforms are actively trying to get you addicted to them.</p>

	<p>The main thing that changed my mind is Cal Newport's book, "Digital Minimalism."  Cal is a computer science professor at Georgetown University.  He has written several books that I have loved, including "Deep Work" and "So Good They Can't Ignore You."  When "Digital Minimalism" came out, I snatched it up.</p>

	<p>Despite being a computer science professor, Cal has never had a Facebook account.  It was kind of by accident, as he tells it - he had started a company during the dot com boom that went under in the early 2000s, and was kind of jealous of Mark Z for making it, so he never signed up.  Later on he heard from friends about how addicted they were to the platform, and he decided to keep his streak going and never sign up for these platforms.</p>

	<p>He starts the book discussing why social media is bad for you, and how they get you addicted.  He interviews a former Facebook employee, who describes why the "Like" button is like the currency of social media.  You post things so that you can get likes.  It's unpredictable whether your post will get a ton of likes and comments, or just a few.  So you keep checking.</p>

	<p>When you login to see if your post got likes or comments, the Newsfeed is set up to show you new and interesting contest and distract you from actually looking at your post.  That's how you get sucked down the rabbit hole of, "oh I was just going on Facebook to check one thing and then I somehow spent 4 hours on it."</p>

	<p>Reading these things and then seeing them actually play out on the social media sites I was using was eye-opening.  It took some of the mystery out of it (though not all - I was still addicted to Instagram for a couple more years).  And I even started seeing some of the other tricks they play.  For example, on Pinterest, a bookmarking site that also has a newsfeed, if you are pinning a bunch of stuff to 1 board, every 3rd or 4th pin it will "accidentally" send you back to the newsfeed.  I am pretty certain that is no accident.  Reading Digital Minimalism and learning the secret marketing techniques these sites employ made it easier for me to see these sites for what they were - slot machines.  And not a "harmless" waste of time.  They are selling our attention, which is effectively our lives, to make money.</p>

	<h3>The trials and triumphs of quitting Instagram</h3>

	<p>The last show in town for me has been Instagram.  I stopped posting regularly on there a while ago, but still was checking frequently for a few reasons.  I got sucked back in because I would use a seller on there to sell clothes, and then that would cause me to use the site again.  I started wasting 2 hours a day just looking at random things on the site.</p>

	<p>I'm a pretty "all or nothing" kind of person.  I can't do moderation.  It opens the door for me to go big with it, and eventually I WILL go big with it, which usually turns out badly for me.  It's the reason I gave up drinking entirely 4.5 years ago, even though most people didn't understand it.  2 hours on Instagram a day is time that I could use for hanging out with my family, improving my career, engaging in more meaningful activities, and especially, in the coming weeks, taking care of a new baby.</p>

	<p>So I cold-turkey quit the site 2 weeks ago.  I'm still technically "on" the site, I just haven't logged in.</p>

	<p>I wish I could say it's been easy, but it hasn't.  Yesterday, actually, was really tough.  I was angry and annoyed most of the day, and couldn't put my finger on why until the end of the day, when I started watching "Gilmore Girls" out of boredom.  I still haven't found a lot of activities that take the place of "exciting" Instagram.  I find myself getting bored and restless very easily.</p>

	<p>And, people nowadays, well, kind of suck.  It seems like most people nowadays would rather be left alone.  I can probably count on my 10 fingers how many people I talk to on a day to day basis.  2020 pretty much killed off all friend prospects that I did have, because now we are all afraid of leaving the house.  Social media was an easy out.</p>

	<p>My drive to stay off of it is greater than my boredom, however.  There's a lot at stake - I know with the baby coming that I will definitely need that extra time.  And in general in my life, as baby gets older, I'd rather spend my time making myself a more interesting person by actually DOING things and LIVING life, rather than living other people's lives.  So I am powering through.</p>

	<h3>Next steps</h3>

	<p>I would like to, someday, actually delete all my social media platforms.  Just deactivating isn't good enough, because there is still the potential to go back.  When you delete, your are done for good.</p>

	<p>In order to do that, I need to put enough distance between the site and myself, so that I can impassively go back on and download all the content off these sites.  I want the content because there are a lot of things from when I was younger that I'd like to preserve.  There are tons of pictures of my son as a baby on Facebook.  Back before I knew what I was doing on Twitter, I used to post just random funny comments every once in a while that I still crack up at.</p>

	<p>For now, I think I'm good with just not looking at the sites, and putting some time and space between me and them.  In 6 months to a year, I will probably go through with deleting them entirely.</p>

	<p>This has all been pretty difficult to admit to.  I mean, I'm almost 40, and here I am admitting that I got sucked into watching random people on Instagram parade around and it affected my quality of life.  But, it is what it is.  I hope that admitting that I had a problem with it, and that I quit even though it wasn't completely taking over my life, will enable anyone else who reads this to potentially make a similar decision if they want to.</p>
