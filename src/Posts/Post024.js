	<p>Hi there...</p>

	<p>This is my daughter, Autumn Jade Foreman!  She was born on 12/6/21.  We've been at home a little over a week!  We are in love with this little peanut - aka Shrimpkin, aka Snuffikins :)  (she has many nicknames around here already)</p>

	<p>Wow, holy huge life change Batman!  It feels like someone has taken all the elements of my life before, put them into a plastic bag and has shaken it up!</p>

	<p>I don't expect to post too much specifically about Autumn on here, just wanted to say that she's arrived and share a cute picture of her.  Perhaps someday I will write a post about balancing coding with being a mom.  If it turns out I can do that, that is!  Remains to be seen... but, I think I can.  I love both, so, I will make it work.</p>

	<p>Merry Christmas to you all!  Take care!</p>
