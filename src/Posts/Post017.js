	<p>I am reading a book called "Grit" by Angela Duckworth.  It has really motivated me to write this post.  Hold on to your butts because it's going to be a long one.</p>

	<h3>About Me in College</h3>

	<p>I don't usually brag about myself.  I don't like to bring up my past accomplishments, I'd rather people find out through getting to know me as I am now.  That's how many people have gone years of knowing me, without finding out that I earned a degree in Electrical Engineering (with a minor in Mathematics) from the University of Illinois.  Engineering is one of the most challenging college majors, and currently, the University of Illinois is ranked 5th in the US for their undergraduate Electrical Engineering program (see <a href="https://grainger.illinois.edu/about/facts-and-rankings">https://grainger.illinois.edu/about/facts-and-rankings</a>).</p>

	<p>At the same time as I was studying engineering, I played on the women's golf team.  University of Illinois is a Big 10 school. <a href="https://www.news-gazette.com/sports/illini-sports/patience-a-virtue-for-cox/article_6b717f4f-feed-5cbf-8be2-195f87d2d12d.html">Here's</a> an article about me from back then (my maiden name was Cox)</p>

	<p>You might think from hearing these facts about me, that I must be pretty smart.  Your typical "type A" student.  That I was one of those kids that cruised through school and barely had to study to get good grades, then went out to party at night.  That would have been nice.</p>

	<p>The truth is, the first 3 years of college were the hardest years of my life.  There was no rest for me, ever, during those years.  I was either in class, studying, practicing golf, or, on rare occasions, sleeping.  I would stay out every weeknight until 2-3 am, studying.  I'd spend entire weekends at the library.  I'd go to every office hour I could, just trying to eek out a B average in my courses.</p>

	<p>At the end of my freshman year (actually, during the time that the article about me was written) I had contracted mononucleosis.  I had it and didn't know it for a couple months.  I remember being bone tired all the time.  It finally blew up during the last tournament of the year.  My throat swelled, I had a fever, and I couldn't play the second day, but I managed to get out and play the last day.  After the tournament, 2 different doctors told me I had a cold, and one of them put me on steroids, which actually made the mono worse.  By the time they figured out what was going on, my mom had to pick me up during finals week and drive me home, and I was in the hospital for 3 days.  I lost 20 pounds.  Luckily the professors let me make up finals during the summer after I had recovered.</p>

	<p>Sophomore year is traditionally "weed-out" year for engineering majors.  During the fall semester, I started dating (and subsequently got dumped by) my first serious boyfriend.  9/11 happened.  All this crazy stuff was going on, and yet somehow I made time for the books and got a straight B average.  Spring semester was way worse.  I screwed up scheduling and ended up with 2 intense engineering classes combined with differential equations (a notorious math class) and the physics class with Schrodinger's cat in it (or maybe not in it - I still don't get it).  All of the quarterly exams ended up falling within 4 days of each other, and at the same time spring golf has more tournaments and events than fall golf.  I remember studying on planes, taking my books to the course on the off chance I'd get a 15 minute window to work on a problem, falling asleep studying super late in hotel rooms after the golf commitments were finally done.  I called my parents more than once, crying that I couldn't do it all, and they basically told me to suck it up.  Still not totally sure how I made it through that semester, but I did.</p>

	<p>During this time, were people cheering me on, telling me how smart and awesome I was?  In fact, it was often the opposite.  This is probably obvious, but engineering and athletics are entirely separate entities.  Engineering people have no interest or knowledge of golf, and golf people had no clue about engineering.</p>

	<p>The engineering professors were fine - great actually.  I really appreciate now how easy it was to work with them with my crazy golf schedule.  It was the golf folks who were hard to deal with.  Several of them, including my coach, told me during my first couple years that I should give up engineering, said that I wouldn't make it.  The girls on the team that I traveled with were especially hard on me.  During that terrible sophmore spring semester that almost broke me, they cornered me in an airport on the way to some tournament, and, out of nowhere, told me that I annoyed them.  They wouldn't give me any specific examples, except to say that sometimes I was forgetful and didn't bring the right outfits to tournaments.  As a 19 year old, still pretty young, to hear these people who I had been golfing with (and before this incident, thought were friends) give me such hard criticism was pretty rough.</p>

	<p>I don't think I'd want to re-live college.  It was, mentally and physically, exhausting.  I felt I was failing at all aspects of my life - education, golf, and social life - no matter how hard I tried to keep on top of it all.  And I had very few people to turn to to give me encouragement.  All I really had were my parents, and my then-boyfriend, now husband, who I met junior year.</p>

	<p>But, weirdly, looking back on it now, I feel almost nostalgic.  Despite all the setbacks that I had to overcome, college was a very meaningful experience.  I am so grateful to early 2000s Marla for not giving up.  I look back at her, the person who spent 2 weeks straight living on 3-4 hours of sleep a night to study for finals in fall 2001, the girl closing down the Green Street Coffee House at 3 am every night of the week - and I feel nothing but total appreciation for her.  She is the backbone of the person I am today.</p>

	<h3>Grit and Hope</h3>

	<p>Grit is defined as passion + perserverance for long-term goals.  Certainly, looking back at myself in college, I had both.  Going back to the book about grit, Angela offers an online test.  I took the test this week, and scored a 4.6, which is higher than, she says, 95% of the population.</p>

	<p>Angela says a core thing that distinguishes people with grit from those without grit is hope.  She says that when bad things happen to people with grit, they have hope that they will get through it.</p>

	<p>I don't disagree with Angela, but the word "hope" to me implies waiting for some external entity to swoop down to make things okay.  Or sitting around, twiddling your thumbs, saying "gee I sure hope this works out!"</p>

	<p>For Marla-in-college, there was no sitting around, twiddling thumbs.  I remember one course, during that fateful sophmore year, where I completely flunked the first exam.  It was a shock - I had never failed a test!  Sure, I was upset and super worried.  But dropping the course never entered my mind.  I started going to as many office hours as I could.  I went over and over the book and did a ton of tough questions until I understood the concepts.  I asked a lot of questions.  I worked harder at it, experimented with new ways of learning the material, and managed to pull myself back from the brink of flunking the class.  I got a C.  I am prouder of that C than of many A's I earned.</p>

	<p>I think Angela meant the same thing, that spirit of - you get knocked down, and instead of giving up, you try something different.  The failure itself motivates you to keep going and try different solutions to the problem.  Failure is just a data point, saying you need to do something different.</p>

	<p>I have a ton more to say on the subject of grit.  To this day, I'm still gritty, but it expresses itself a lot differently now than it did 15 years ago when I left college.  And I'm sure that in 15 more years, grit will look different again.  We will revisit grit again another day.</p>
