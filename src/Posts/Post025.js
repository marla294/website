	<p>Hello again!</p>

	<p>Well, I'm back here a little sooner than I thought I'd be!  So, having a baby, especially being on the mom side of things, is pretty weird.  Like I mentioned in my last post, it feels like someone truly did throw all the elements of my life into a plastic bag and shook it up.  Though - to be clear, before I had this baby I already was a mom to Miles (age 9) - I think it was the new mom stupor that made me say I had to "see" if I can code and mom at the same time.  Um of course I can do that, I've been doing it all along!  Just not with a little baby - my son was 5 when I morphed into "Developer Mom".  That's kinda more what I meant there - can I do this with a wee tiny baby?  Signs point to "hell yah," but we'll see.</p>

	<p>Anyhoo, yeah.  Life feels pretty messed up right now.  I went from having only 1 kid and coding 8 hours a day, had 1 weekend, and then went off and had a baby on a Monday morning at 8 am!  Now I have no job to go to (because maternity leave), my husband's at home all day too (he has 4 weeks of paternity leave!) and I spend a large portion of the day holding a baby :). Major life change!</p>

	<p>Although I love my lil baby girl so so much, and my husband is helping out a ton with her and being just the best husband, and my son loves his new sister too - major life changes are hard.  It's hard to go instantly from doing the same thing you've done every day for almost 3 years, to, blam, STAY AT HOME AND RELAX WITH YO BABY ALL THE TIME.</p>

	<p>So, in order to help my mental sanity, I've dug back into the development work/crap that I did in the "before times" a little earlier than anticipated.  And I figured, why not write a blog post about what I'm doing.  Sure.</p>

	<h3>Reading "Righting Software"</h3>

	<p>My coworker Curtis is a software architect and he is a big follower of iDesign.  The dude who developed iDesign wrote a book called "Righting Software" explaining the technique.  Curtis hearts this book.  So I bought it and am reading it.  Hopefully when I come back I will get yelled at less by Curtis for using the "wrong" design (kidding - he doesn't yell at me, he holds lunch and learns to dissect what I did wrong and use it as a learning opportunity!!!  Which, because of the type of person I am, I am amused by this :))</p>

	<p>To be clear, I don't take any book about anything to be "the law almighty."  I have even seen iDesign work in practice - that is what we use to code our projects, and I believe the system has worked well.  I think it's a good system, and I enjoy this book so far and they have got some great ideas and reasoning.  Yet, it's not the be-all-end-all for me - nothing ever will be, because I am always open to hearing and evaluating new ideas.</p>

	<h3>Completing Angular course + development of recipe app</h3>

	<p>Ok so I was working on this Angular course, which, literally, is like "the course that never ends."  I made it about 95% through, into the bonus sections, and I just yesterday decided to call it.  Like, wow.  I have never seen a course this long in my life!  It was really good, and jeez I learned a whole lot about Angular in the process!  AND I learned Redux, which I have been wanting to learn for a long time!  But I mean, it's been 6 months of work to get here.  Time to move on with my life.</p>

	<p>So, very conveniently, in the course they develop a recipe app.  I had an idea before starting the course to develop a shopping list app for my own personal use.  I would like to make shopping for groceries a very time-limited activity - I'd like to make it take less than 15 minutes.  That's the dream.  Right now it takes me over an hour to make the list, look in my pantry, figure out if I have the ingredients or if I need to buy more, and order the groceries online from the correct stores.  Wouldn't it be cool to have an app where I can generate the list, go through the house and check off what I have, and then click a button to buy the groceries and set up deliveries from (in my case) Whole Foods and Hyvee?  Oooh yeah.  Saving myself 1 hour a week is nothing to sniff at.</p>

	<h3>Reading "Atomic Habits"</h3>

	<p>My husband is also having a "full life meltdown" of sorts being off on paternity leave for a month.  He started reading "Atomic Habits".  I had started reading that book a couple years ago but only made it like 37% of the way through, so I picked it back up again out of interest.</p>

	<h3>Listening to Cal Newport's podcast</h3>

	<p>Cal Newport's podcast, "Deep Questions," is literally the only podcast I listen to these days.  If you are a fellow nerd like me (and, dare I say, Cal) I suggest giving it a try.</p>

	<h3>Meditation</h3>

	<p>Finally, the thing that I do every day regardless of whatever else is going on.  I'm going to keep on doing it.  I use Headspace.  If I miss a day, I can definitely tell a big difference - by the end of the day I'm like "why am I so sad/angry/annoyed?  Oh yeah I didn't meditate."</p>

	<p>Welp, that's all folks!  Hope you are doing well, and again Merry Christmas!</p>
