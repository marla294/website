					I recently finished the Ron Chernow biography of Alexander
					Hamilton, which the "Hamilton" musical was based on, and
					decided it would be fun to write a little review of it on
					here, what the heck. I love reading books about historical
					figures. You can see how the people in the past were just
					like us, but without televison... or computers... or...
					electricity (depending how far back you go). And we're just
					like them except we don't have to wear powdered wigs.
					Anyway! I want to talk through the top things I found
					interesting while reading the book.
				</p>

				<h4>There were differences between the book and the musical</h4>

				<p>
					That the musical is not an exact copy of the book or of
					history is probably not news. It was obvious with Miranda's
					choice of actors and actresses, who were deliberately of
					different lineage than our actual founding fathers, that the
					musical was not meant to be completely accurate.
				</p>

				<p>
					The main thing that is glossed over a bit in the musical
					that is heavily covered in the book is Hamilton's political
					downfall in later years. Hamilton's reputation took a
					nosedive after the Reynolds pamphlet and never fully
					recovered. Hamilton and President Adams absolutely could not
					stand each other. Hamilton made some major mistakes in
					dealing with Adams that pretty much cost him his career in
					politics. In the musical, Hamilton's downfall is largely
					glossed over. It seems like his depressed state at the end
					is mostly due to the death of his son, Philip, who died in a
					duel in 1801.
				</p>

				<p>
					Regardless, I felt that the musical was historically
					accurate enough for what it was. It is a different medium
					for telling Hamilton's story, and is meant for
					entertainment. Part of the purpose of the book, back when
					Chernow wrote it, was to increase awareness of what Hamilton
					did for our nation. Because of this, historical accuracy was
					more important (though, Chernow was undoubtedly biased
					toward Hamilton). Plus, Chernow had 832 pages in which to
					discuss Hamilton's life, while Lin Manuel Miranda only had 2
					hours.
				</p>

				<h4>Hamilton was a prodigy</h4>

				<p>
					It is amazing when you read about the amount of work that
					Hamilton actually accomplished during his relatively short
					life. He wrote part of the Federalist papers (which helped
					to shape the foundation of the American government) while on
					a boat from Albany. He taught himself law in under one year,
					and, sidenote, is finally getting an official law degree
					from Albany Law School this year! The amount of work that he
					produced in such a short time was phenomenal.
				</p>

				<p>
					Bill Gates in his early days reminds me of Hamilton. When
					Gates was developing the BASIC programming language for the
					MITS Altair, he had a short time window to work in. He would
					work into the middle of the night, fall asleep at his
					keyboard, and then wake up an hour or two later and resume
					coding. If Hamilton were born today, and a developer, I'm
					sure he would be doing the exact same thing! Maybe Bill
					Gates is Hamilton reincarnated.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is inspiring to look at the amount that Hamilton
					produced. It makes you feel like, if he can do so much,
					maybe I could do it too!
				</p>

				<h4>Jefferson was an interesting president</h4>

				<p>
					Before reading this book, my impression of Thomas Jefferson
					was that he was one of the great presidents. That he was
					noble and peaceful and distinguished. And overall, boring.
					But the Jefferson I read about in the Hamilton biography was
					anything but boring.
				</p>

				<figure className="post_contentImg left">

						src="/Images/Pictures/Posts/Post002/jefferson.jpg"
						alt="Thomas Jefferson"
					/>
					<figcaption className="figcaption">

				</figure>

				<p>
					Thomas did some great things. He put to words the
					Declaration of Independance. He made the Louisiana Purchase
					and launched the Louis and Clark expidition during his
					presidency. He deserves to be seen as one of the main presidents that shaped the nation,
					presidents, just like Washington and Lincoln.
				</p>

				<p>
					But, unlike Washington and Lincoln, Jefferson had a dark
					side. He seemed to see Hamilton as an evil presence, out to
					destroy the nation. He hated Hamilton, and did his best to
					sabotage him at every turn. While he was Secretary of State
					under Washington, he hired Philip Freneau to run a newspaper
					called the National Gazette. The main thing that this
					newspaper did was print false stories about Hamilton (then
					Treasury Secretary) and the Federalists to try to take them
					down. He turned Madison, Hamilton's former friend who helped
					write the Federalist papers, against Hamilton, and they
					started working together to dismantle Hamilton's career.
				</p>

				<p>
					Jefferson's presence also seemed a bit different than I had
					imagined. He presented himself in an almost lazy manner,
					like a relaxed farmer. He was apparently often unkempt, and
					even appeared to visitors who visited him at the White House
					in his pajamas and slippers!
				</p>

				<h4>
					Hamilton's downfall was caused by his inability to "just let
					it go, already"
				</h4>

				<figure className="post_contentImg right">
					<img
						onClick={this.props.showFullImage}
						src="/Images/Pictures/Posts/Post002/duel.jpg"
						alt="Hamilton and Burr Duel"
					/>
					<figcaption className="figcaption">
						Hamilton and Burr's duel
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					The biggest lesson I took away from this book was the
					importance of a person to know when to turn the other cheek
					when they feel they have been slighted. Hamilton did not seem
					to have this ability. In fact, he went far out of his way to
					protect his honor, way further than he probably should have.
				</p>

				<p>
					The biggest example of this was the duel with Aaron Burr.
					The duel literally was over a disagreement of whether
					Hamilton called Burr "despicable" during a dinner party
					months prior. Hamilton could have easily settled the
					disagreement early on by simply saying that he couldn't
					remember if he said it or not but he was sorry. That was it.
					But he couldn't bring himself to apologize, to the point
					where it cost him his life.
				</p>

				<p>
					When you read the book and see the number of disagreements
					and giant battles he fought, it almost makes you feel
					surprised that he didn't die in a duel earlier. I almost
					felt slight sympathy for Burr, because if he hadn't shot
					Hamilton in a duel, someone else probably would have.
				</p>

				<p>
					The amount that Hamilton accomplished in his short life was
					phenomenal. It's hard to say he could have had more of an
					impact. But if he had had the ability to choose his battles
					wisely, instead of going after every single person that
					slighted him, perhaps he could have avoided that duel with
					Burr, and lived a longer, happier, and more prosperous life.
