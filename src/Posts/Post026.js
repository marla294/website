		Today was supposed to be my first day back from maternity leave.  Well, turns out, it's not.  I decided to move on from Fixation a couple weeks ago, while I was still on leave.  I was planning to come back part time for a few months, then go back full time, but things changed and they can't support that anymore, and I don't have care for Autumn.  They did offer to let me come back full time later on, but I chose to move on for good.  I wish them the best, no hard feelings at all.

		Part of the reason I left for realzies was because I've wanted to be a front end developer for a while.  I like both .NET and JavaScript.  And there are things that I really like about working with server side that aren't there in JavaScript (I like the stronger typing in C#, for example).  But I would like to hone my skills in one area.  It's hard to get really good at one thing when you are doing full stack.  You gotta switch it up from JavaScript/Angular/Jquery to .NET/C# and then to SQL and writing SQL scripts.  I'd rather focus my attention on just one part of it.

		Also, there's a lot you can do with frontend development.  This site is a static site in React.  I've built sites that hook up to Firebase and store data there (and I actually intend to hook up this site to Firebase as well in the near future).  It is more difficult to build and deploy a functional, good looking website using .NET framework, in my opinion.

		So, the plan now is, I'm going to spend the next few months revisiting React and getting good at it.  Then I'm going to look for a more front-endy type of job.

		Have to admit that I'm pretty sad right now.  I was looking forward to going back to work.  But, it's important to me to be here for Autumn right now while she is little.  Plus I've wanted to make this change for a while.  I wanted to be a front end developer when I was first learning to code, but had to take what I could get in terms of jobs, and what I could get was full stack.  This seems like it is the perfect time to make the change.  Contrary to popular belief, you actually CAN find time to code with a baby.  Little known fact - babies sleep.  A lot.  I can actually get around 3-4 hours of coding in per day while Autumn is sleeping or hanging out on her playmat.
