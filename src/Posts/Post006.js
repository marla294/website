		<p>I am absolutely thrilled to say on here that yesterday I accepted a job offer for a software engineering position here in Omaha, Nebraska!  Volano Solutions is the name of the company.  They do custom application development to improve workflow for businesses, and also have their own product.  Their stack is front end Angular (Ionic) and ASP.NET!</p>

		<p>There were a lot of things that made me want to work there.  When I first looked at their website, the very first line in their About page says "We're life-long learners."  I thought, if there's anything that describes me better than "doesn't follow directions," life-long learner would be it.  They are really engaged with their clients.  At the interview they told me that the developers work directly with their clients.  I really enjoy working with clients and coming up with solutions, and this is something I haven't seen too much at other places, so I'm pretty excited about that aspect.  Finally, it just seems like a really collaborative environment and a good place to work!</p>

		<p>The main reason I have wanted to get a job as a software developer is not because of the title, or the money, or other material things.  It's because I love software, and I love making it, and I want to learn from other people who have been doing it longer than me and get better at it!  While I've been off work (a year and a half), I've really missed getting to learn new things from other people... I'm so happy and looking forward to this next chapter.</p>

		<p>Obviously I have to put the disclaimer in here of, this is just the beginning.  I'm sure there will be days at first where I feel like, OMG I know nothing.  And the hard work I have been putting in will continue.  I think if you know me in real life, you already know this :)</p>

		<p>There are a lot of reasons why it has taken me "so long" to find something (I say that in quotes because I feel it's relative).  I'll get into that in another post, I think that discussion of the (many!) things I've learned from searching for a job in software development could help others.  The thing I think is going to be hardest about actually starting a job is, I've gotten to a good place with coding on my own and keeping myself going and motivated.  I will actually miss this a bit!  It will be a change, but I know I can do it.</p>

		<p>Thanks so much for reading!</p>
