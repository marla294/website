		<h4>Hi.</h4>
		<p>
			To be totally transparent, I don't really know what I'm going to
			write about here. I have some ideas floating around but, I made this
			thing mostly so that I could have a project to do in React. I am not
			the biggest code-project idea generator in the world, and that's why
			over the past year of learning to code, this is my 3rd blog that
			I've built from the ground up. Sure helped me get better at HTML and
			CSS that way. The funny thing is, after I create the blog, writing
			IN the blog is actually the hardest part.
		</p>
		<p>
			I kind of want to keep it to one subject area. It seems like it
			would get annoying if I talked about like, my personal life in one
			post and then went and talked about development stuff. But on the
			other hand, I kind of WANT to talk about both, and I have pretty
			interesting stuff to talk about in both areas... so we'll see.
		</p>
		<p>
			As per usual with me, I created this website from scratch. It is
			built in ReactJS. In my humble opinion, there are a few cool things
			in this website that I had to do to build it, like lazy-loading
			components and CSS Grid, so if you're interested, check it out -
			source code is on Github in the "website" project. And I'm not done
			with it! There's a lot more I want to do.
		</p>
		<p>Anyway, if you're here, I'm glad to have you.</p>
