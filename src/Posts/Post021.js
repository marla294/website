	<p>I promised you all a blog post on ideas for continuing to learn as a professional developer, and I am delivering on that promise.  Here are my thoughts.</p>

	<h3>No matter where you are on this, give yourself a huge break</h3>

	<p>This topic is number one because I think it’s really important.</p>

	<p>I’m teaching my son to golf right now.  I’ve watched some youtube videos on how to get kids interested in the sport.  They stress that the number 1 rule is to make it fun.  If you take them out there and focus on their swing and everything they are doing wrong, and make them go out every day even when they don’t want to, it’s not going to be fun for them anymore and they won’t keep going.  But if they get to drive the golf cart and do silly things like hit water balloons, or hit golf balls into the lake, it’ll keep them coming back.  Continuing to come back and try again is the the key - long term practice is how you get good at something, whether it be a sport or a profession.</p>

	<p>The same idea applies to us as adults.  There are a lot of messages out there telling us that we need to learn the hot new technology, or if we don’t spend an extra 20 hours a week learning in addition to our full time jobs, we’re somehow deficient and we’ll get left behind.  I personally have been a victim to these messages and have had to learn how to let them go in one ear and right out the other.</p>

	<p>On one hand, it is very important to place an emphasis on continuing to learn, and specifically to learn things that YOU want to learn.  But at the same time it is also important to make sure you aren’t burning yourself out, and that what you are learning is relevant to your skills and your job.  Some of us do have time and the drive to do an extra 20 hours of coding per week - if that’s you, that’s awesome, carry on!  I am not trying to discourage you here!  But if you have responsibilities outside of work, or even if you just have hobbies that are important to you outside work, those are important too.  It is just as important that you aren’t burning yourself out and that you are learning new things because you want to, not because you feel you have to.</p>

	<h3>Pick a job where learning is valued and recognized as an integral part of software development work</h3>

	<p>A disclaimer - this is a topic where I could easily veer into negativity.  I will do my best to keep this somewhat high level, but at the same time I feel responsible to help teach others from what I learned from a difficult experience.  Some discussion of sensitive topics may be required to have a net positive outcome.</p>

	<p>I have worked at a job where learning was clearly not valued, and the founders appeared to be actively trying to stamp it out wherever they could.  On the front page of the website for this company, it states that one of their “core values” is learning.  And that’s what was reiterated to me throughout the interview.  It was a big shock once I got in there and found out what they were really about.  I got fooled because I was new to the career and didn’t know the right questions to ask, and I just needed a damn job after a year of searching.</p>

	<p>Bad software companies won’t come clean and tell you outright, “Look, we don’t want you to learn at all here, we treat developers as interchangeable cogs, and we feel we could pick up random person off the street tomorrow and train them to do your job.  Most of all, we don’t want you to get any value out of working here, we only want to extract value from you.”  No, they are going to pretend to the outside world and to developers they are hiring that they are one of those good places where developers want to work (in my example, they will even give talks on this topic at developer conferences!).  Then, once they have roped you in, they begin the brainwashing.  They will penalize you for spending extra time trying to do a task the right way, instead of just shoehorning code in as fast as possible, and try to hold you back until you give up and do the shoehorning.  Then the developers there will say things like “work to live, don’t live to work!” or “job security!” while they pretend to work on their spaghetti-filled legacy projects, or they’ll say “it’s like this everywhere.”  You won’t get an empathetic “this is really stupid” from anyone inside the organization, because they are all busy trying to defend why they are still there.</p>

	<p>The key, at any job where you feel you aren't respected, is to trust the uncomfortable feeling in your gut much more than what the folks there are telling you.  When you strongly feel like you aren’t learning anything or moving forward, you probably aren’t totally off-base.  Those people saying “it’s like this everywhere” and other things are telling you that to justify staying in a job that is treating them badly too, but they don’t have the motivation or desire to get out.</p>

	<p>I will tell you right now, it’s not like that everywhere.  I went from one consulting company to another, working on very similar projects, and the one I jumped to does value learning.  They have unit tests and they do pull requests - oh boy, do they do pull requests!  They put me on tasks that are well outside my comfort zone of “implement this CRUD page.”  For example, right now at work I’m hooking up both node apps and .NET applications to report their errors to App Insights and tell us on Slack if an error occurred.  I’ve never done that before!  Everybody at my job has over 10 years of development experience, and they are all smarter and better at it than me.  And I am glad about that - I want to work with people who are better and know more than me, so I can learn from them!  It’s not perfect, it is still consulting, which with its focus on billable hours is imperfect applied to knowledge work, but it is a huge step up.  So, use me as proof if you have to.</p>

	<p>If you feel you are not challenged in your current position, and you’ve given them a pretty hefty grace period for things to turn around (I say 6 months, and preferably you have directly told your boss that you don’t feel you are progressing), then it might be time to look for a different place where you can expand your skills and try new things.  You’re allowed to use at least part of that 40 hours to increase your own value, while at the same time of course providing value to your employer.  Any software company worth working at will recognize this.  In my opinion, finding a good job will help you learn more than anything you can feasibly accomplish outside of work.</p>

	<h3>Choose your outside of work learning carefully, and plan how much time you will spend on it each week.  Aim low at first</h3>

	<p>Ok, so you have cut yourself a lot of slack for not coding 80 hours a week like SuperWoman (or Man), and you’ve ensured you are in a job where you are learning and not just cranking the same old widgets for 40 hours a week for years and years on end.  You still would like to spend some time coding on your own.  Now what?</p>

	<p>We're reserve most of the topic of “what to learn” for the next blog post.  But I will share what my current strategy is and what I’m doing.</p>

	<p>I am going through a very long, but very good Angular online course.  It seems to cover everything, soup to nuts, and even though I have worked in Angular before (and we work on Angular at my job) I have learned a lot from it so far - about 50% done.</p>

	<p>I learn on the weekends.  I spend 2 hours every weekend and just do this course.  That doesn’t seem like a lot - and it is taking me a long time to get through it - but for right now that’s about my limit.</p>

	<p>After I get through the course, I will take the course project (a recipe app) and convert it to use for my own purposes.  About a year ago, I got burned by a recipe app on my phone that I had used for years and it suddenly went paid.  When I refused to upgrade it deleted all my recipes!  So I decided to switch to a different (manual) system, but it isn’t perfect.  Right now I spend about an hour each week planning what to get from the grocery store.  That time could be condensed to under 5 minutes if I create an app that combines all the ingredients from the recipes I want to make that week into a shopping list for me.  The app we’re creating in the course is not exactly what I need, but it is fairly close, so why reinvent the wheel?</p>

	<p>I think going low on the number of extra hours you put in, but making sure those hours are spent on something that is relevant to your work or something you can use in the rest of your life, is the key to the sustained effort needed to keep you doing this for years to come.  I know myself, and if I were to say right now that I need to do 5 hours each weekend of extra learning, I would do it once or twice and then give up.  And then I wouldn’t do anything.  I do want to potentially increase the hours, very slowly, but maybe by adding an extra half hour and go 2.5 hours for a month or two.  Then 3.  Slow and steady wins the race.</p>

	<p>When the baby comes, things will change a lot, and at that time I’ll have to re-evaluate what I’m doing.  Maybe it means taking a total break from the extra learning for a few months, or maybe I only make myself do a tiny bit each weekend.  We will see!</p>

	<p>Anyway, I hope this is helpful!  Next time I will talk about what is useful to learn when you are trying to learn as a developer.  Sounds simplistic, but trust - I have thoughts!  See you then!</p>
