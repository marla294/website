For example, on Pinterest, a bookmarking site that also has a newsfeed, if you are pinning a bunch of stuff to 1 board, every 3rd or 4th pin it will "accidentally" send you back to the newsfeed.  I am pretty certain that is no accident.  Reading Digital Minimalism and learning the secret marketing techniques these sites employ made it easier for me to see these sites for what they were - slot machines.
