This is a post that I've wanted to write for a very long time, just couldn't make up my mind to do it.  Lately there have been so many changes going on in my life, and I guess I've just gotten tired of hiding this dumb thing about myself, and just want to get it out there so I can let it go."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"I'm a non-drinker.  I've been sober since July 2017.  So about 2.5 years at this point."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Why I chose to give it up is a hard question to answer.  And that's also what makes this post hard to write, and hard for me to talk about this.  I was diagnosed with depression in my 20s, and struggled with it for a long time.  Drinking really affects my mood, and I believe it made my depression worse.  I was taking medication and having to talk with a lot of counselors before I stopped drinking, but nothing really seemed to work.  Now I feel so much better day to day.  I'm not on any medication for depression or seeing anyone for it, and, with the addition of better diet and exercise, I can say that I don't feel I have depression anymore.  Which is pretty amazing."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"I don't miss drinking.  When I first gave it up, I thought that life was going to be so boring.  It has been anything but!  I've been able to do a whole lot more than I was able to do back when I was drinking.  I don't generally think about it day to day.  I hardly ever find myself wanting to drink, except maybe occasionally at a party."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"The thing that is hard is that I already stand out in a lot of ways.  I'm an old woman developer :)  LOL, it's true though.  I'm on the fast track to 40ville, which is considered \"old\" in software development land.  And I'm a woman which also makes me stand out a bit.  The fact that I don't drink, and people seem to think that either I'm a prude, or I was an alcoholic, because I haven't been able to say why I don't drink, on top of everything else.... SUCKS!!!  So getting this out there and setting the record straight is pretty relieving."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Finally, I don't judge people who drink, unless they judge me for not drinking!  It is actually fun for me to hang out with people while they're drinking.  My last job at Volano used to have happy hour every Friday at 4, and it was nice to chat with everybody at that.  So, no shade thrown on those who still do drink."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Later dudes."))};t.default=i}});
