To say it has been challenging would be an understatement. There have been quite a few days where I have woken up and have felt like a failure. I have had to learn how to dig deep and keep going anyway. Finding this place where I can still be content with where I am, even though I am not yet where I want to be, has been one of my main focuses of the past year.
