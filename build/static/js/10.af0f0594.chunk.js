Obviously, a lot has changed since I last wrote anything on here in February.

Something I've been thinking about lately is how happy I am with my new career in web development.  As you know I was a software QA for about 8 years, and then almost 3 years ago left my last QA job to teach myself to code.  Now I've been coding professionally for the past year and a half and, I've got some thoughts on what I'm liking about it."),n.a.createElement("h3",null,"1. Learning new things"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Of course this one had to top the list.  Learning stuff is my thing!  It's why I got into software development in the first place."),n.a.createElement("p",null,'One great thing about being in a job (as opposed to when I was just going it alone) is that I get to see how other people code on the same sorts of things.  I really like it when someone solves a tough problem in a novel way and I can pick up their tricks and do it better the next time.  I\'m not afraid to say to people I know are better coders than me, "do you have any ideas on how I could do this better?"'),n.a.createElement("h3",null,"2. Solving problems"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Maybe part of the reason I love learning so much is because it helps me solve problems.  I like creating new development, but I also love it when there is a tricky little bug, and I have to fix it.  It is so rewarding when you find that Stack Overflow answer that you can slap in there that fits just right ;)  (I SWEAR TO YOU, THAT WAS A JOKE!)  Kidding aside, I have become a lot better at googling things, and when I have a problem to solve that's usually the first thing I do.  It's just the best feeling when you have an issue and you're able to get it working and check that thing off the list!"),n.a.createElement("h3",null,"3. Having the confidence that I can solve problems"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Another cool thing that has happened is that I now have the confidence that if you present me with your garden variety bug (hey can you make this a sticky navbar and use our theme css that you haven't worked with yet?)

Bringing clients' dreams into reality"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"The project I am currently working on is for a super nice married couple who had an idea for an entrepreneurial venture.

There are always at least one or two good ones at every place, if not more (usually more!).  But man, at my current job, there are only 4 other people, and I like all of them very much!

The tools we have to secure our work"),n.a.createElement("p",null,'From what I hear, I am lucky to have "come of age" as a web developer in a time when we have great tools to code on.  As a .NET developer, I use Visual Studio 2019 for my ASP.NET MVC code, and VS Code for any JavaScript.  Both those IDEs are pretty slick.  Git is built into Visual Studio, so I just use that, though I learned the basics on command line.  We\'ve used ADO at both of my jobs for issue tracking and pull requests, and we use Azure to host the site.'),n.a.createElement("p",null,"It is crazy to think how many tools that developers have to secure their work, while as a quality assurance engineer, we typically had like a shared Excel file or something and that was it.

Being on the positive "making things happen" end of the cycle now'),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Since we're on the topic of QA, it sure is nice to be on the end of the software lifecycle where I'm not having to complain all the time!

I got lost in the shuffle.  I'd feel like the places didn't care about me.

Getting to make tangible things"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Making things has been in my nature since I was a kid.  One thing that was missing for me in QA was that aspect of creation.  People would say that you have a \"hand\" in creating the software as a QA, but I had a tough time making that connection.  It's a lot easier when you're literally writing the code that becomes the software to say, I made that.  That is a super satisfying feeling, to get to see the things that you have built come to life and be used in the real world - even if they break or don't get used as much as you would hope!"),n.a.createElement("h3",null,"10. Respect"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Maybe someone already said this, but to me, respect is like air.

It's not about being the best developer in the room.  It's more that, I'm trying to be the best developer I can be, I'm trying to do my best for them, and that's okay with everybody I work with.  Nobody's there trying to bring me down or using scare tactics to get me to do the work faster."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"This isn't just that you get respect as a developer and not in QA.  Because, hah, I wasn't respected at Volano!  If I had stayed in QA, I would have eventually found a good job in town.  I just think that it is easier to find those sorts of jobs as a developer.  There are more opportunities, and therefore, more chances to find that right fit."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Alright, that is it!
