Volano was software consulting and so is my current job at Fixation, so now after a year I have a pretty good idea!"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"The main difference is who owns the product you are working on.  At your typical software company, the company you are working for owns the software, and they make money off of selling it to other people.  For example, I worked at D3 Banking (now owned by NCR) for a year, which was a traditional software company.  They made software which they could customize and sell to banks."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"At a software consulting company, someone else outside the company owns the software.  You are building it for them, but your company does not own it.  This can take a lot of forms.  Sometimes the project is huge - basically you are the tech support team for a company that doesn't have a technical team.  Sometimes the projects are medium-sized or small - build a website that one person has dreamed up.  And sometimes the projects have already been built by another team and you are updating them."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"It is almost like freelancing, except that you typically don't have to find the projects yourself.  The company does the work of finding those projects.  They also have support in place for project management, and other things you'd get at a traditional company (health benefits etc) that you wouldn't get while freelancing.  You can just concentrate on the coding and not have to worry about the overhead stuff.  I kind of think of it as \"a band of developers, coming together for the common good\" :)"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"So that's the main difference, but how does that translate into the day-to-day operational differences between these companies?  Here are some of the things I've noticed."),n.a.createElement("h3",null,"Bill by the hour"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"The biggest difference is that consulting places bill by the hour.  At the beginning of a project, they will talk with the client and come up with an estimate of how long it will take to complete the project.  As you are going along in the project lifecycle, you are constantly checking to make sure that you're not going over hours."),n.a.createElement("p",null,'This is way different from a normal software company.  At a typical software company, they don\'t really care that much about how much time a feature takes you - they just say "get this thing done by X date."

Sometimes things that seem simple (ahem CSS ahem) can take an enormous amount of time to figure out.  And sometimes things that seem big and scary and complex take less time.

In consulting, you could be working on a new project, while playing a support role on one of the older projects.  If the client calls you in the middle of work on new development, well, sometimes you have to drop what you're doing and go work on that.  It's the nature of the beast.  In a traditional software company you wouldn't have that as much.  You for sure don't have clients calling you up at all hours asking you to complete tasks for them.  And they typically seem to assign people to one or two projects at a time, and that's it."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"I'd say that time management skills are important in a consulting role.  To me this means, being a professional and when something comes up and you can't make a deadline, being honest with your project manager or client about it and working out a solution instead of hiding it and powering through.  If you're working at a good place they'll understand."),n.a.createElement("h3",null,"Exposure to the full stack"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"The last thing that I've seen that is different from a typical software company is that you are typically a \"jack of all trades\" in consulting.

They'll have a front end developer, a server side developer, quality assurance engineers, devops.  For each of those roles you can get really in depth with it.  Front end development has become it's own monster in recent years, with TONS of different frameworks to choose from, and each one has its own suite of tools.
