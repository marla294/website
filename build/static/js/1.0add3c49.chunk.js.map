It is kind of a multi-purpose tool.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>I also really like that you are forced to use functional components instead of component classes to use hooks.  JavaScript is a language based on functions.  Classes are syntactic sugar.  Hooks allow you to get back to the basics of JavaScript, and start thinking of it as the prototype-based language that it is.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h5>The Confusing</h5>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>There are some downsides to hooks.  To any companies thinking about switching, I can see how it would be challenging to have to change all your component classes over to functional components using hooks.  Especially since the old way of using state will be supported in the future.  Maybe it wouldn't be worth the time or effort in some cases.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>The other couple things I ran into while using hooks may be possibly due to hooks not being out in an official release yet.  One thing is that the Chrome React dev tools, which I use heavily for debugging React, don't seem to support hooks yet.  The State dropdown is real confusing.  Maybe I'm not understanding it properly, but it's not intuitive to figure out.  So that's been a bit of a bummer.</p>\r\n\r\n                <p><strike>Also, I found that component refs don't work with functional components, which means they don't work with hooks.  My example was that I needed to blur an input component, and for that I needed a component ref.  You can't do a component reference with functional components.  No idea if they plan to support that in the future or not, or if it even can be supported.</strike>  After publishing this post, my brother (senior software engineer <a href=\"https://raymondjcox.com\">RJ Cox</a> at Drift) sent me <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref\" alt=\"React documentation for refs\">this link</a> about creating references with hooks in the React documentation.  I haven't tried it yet, but it might be the solution to using component refs with hooks.</p>\r\n\r\n\t</React.Fragment>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default PostData;\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/Posts/Post005.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
