Their stack is front end Angular (Ionic) and ASP.NET!"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"There were a lot of things that made me want to work there.  When I first looked at their website, the very first line in their About page says \"We're life-long learners.\"  I feel that that phrase describes me too!  They are really engaged with their clients.  At the interview they told me that the developers work directly with their clients.  I really enjoy working with clients and coming up with solutions, and this is something I haven't seen too much at other places, so I'm pretty excited about that aspect.  Finally, it just seems like a really collaborative environment and a good place to work!"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"The main reason I have wanted to get a job as a software developer is because I love software, I love making it, and I want to learn from other people who have been doing it longer than me and get better at it!

I'll get into that in another post, I think that discussion of the (many!) things I've learned from searching for a job in software development could help others.  The thing I think is going to be hardest about actually starting a job is, I've gotten to a good place with coding on my own and keeping myself going and motivated.  I will actually miss this a bit!
