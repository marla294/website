I sort of knew what I was getting into, but at the time I joined I had been on the job hunt for a while and was honestly kind of desperate.  It was okay for a first job, I could have hung out there a bit longer, just not something that was going to work for me for more than a year or two.  And this job IS the right fit for some people - there are several people there who describe Volano as being like a \"family\" to them.  It just wasn't for me.  I wish them all the best."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Up until now, Volano has been the smallest company I've worked at with only 19 employees.  Fixation is even smaller at... 4.  I will be the 5th employee.  Wow!  Every job I work at, the company keeps getting smaller.  I started at Northrop Grumman with (currently) 85,000 employees, and now I'm down to a 4 person company."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Even though they are small, I was very surprised and impressed with Fixation when I came in for an interview.  They had had me complete a pretty intense technical problem over a weekend - create a web application in .NET Framework for a veterinary clinic, connected to SQL and everything.  I was happy to do it though, it forced me to finally figure out some environment issues on my home setup and also it was good practice.  When I came in for the in person interview, they had taken the time to pull down and review my web application, which was nice. They gave me really good feedback on it that we discussed."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"I was also able to ask them a lot of questions about how they build software - okay, truthfully I kinda grilled them :)  It's important to me that they are doing the standard practices to create quality software - basic things like, how do you handle bug tracking, do you do unit testing, do you have code reviews?  They passed with flying colors."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Finally, I just liked them.  It seems like they are trying to do things the right way, and we are all on a similar wavelength about what quality software is."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"I'll be starting next Friday.  Until then, going to relax, take a course on Udemy I've been meaning to get to for a while, and get my frickin' MacBook spacebar fixed (stupid keys get stuck easily).  Later!"))};t.default=i}});
