They will penalize you for spending extra time trying to do a task the right way, instead of just shoehorning code in as fast as possible, and try to hold you back until you give up and do the shoehorning.  Then the developers there will say things like \u201cwork to live, don\u2019t live to work!\u201d or \u201cjob security!\u201d while they pretend to work on their spaghetti-filled legacy projects, or they\u2019ll say \u201cit\u2019s like this everywhere.\u201d  You won\u2019t get an empathetic \u201cthis is really stupid\u201d from anyone inside the organization, because they are all busy trying to defend why they are still there."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"The key, at any job where you feel you aren't respected, is to trust the uncomfortable feeling in your gut much more than what the folks there are telling you.

So I decided to switch to a different (manual) system, but it isn\u2019t perfect.  Right now I spend about an hour each week planning what to get from the grocery store.  That time could be condensed to under 5 minutes if I create an app that combines all the ingredients from the recipes I want to make that week into a shopping list for me.
